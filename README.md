# pneumonia-detection
This project aims to assist in the diagnosis of pneumonia through analyzing chest X-ray images. Pneumonia is a prevalent and potentially fatal lung infection, making early and accurate detection crucial for effective treatment.

This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a class of deep learning models particularly effective for image analysis, to classify X-ray images into NORMAL and PNEUMONIA cases. The dataset, consisting of these two categories, was meticulously augmented and preprocessed to ensure optimal performance during training.

The CNN model achieved an impressive accuracy of up to 95%, showcasing its potential as an automated pneumonia detection tool.

# About Dataset
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) of the chest X-ray images is available on Kaggle platform. The dataset contains two classed: NORMAL and PNEUMONIA.

# Result
The model achieved an accuracy of 95% on the test dataset.
